# ApiDebugger
This project is exclusively a way for me to try new things.
It is supposed to become a basic tool for debugging APIs with a simple web-ui.
Technology used: Golang, HTMX, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, YAML.

For an example of how to configure endpoints refer to the [dev config.yaml file](https://github.com/franz-dalitz/api-debugger/blob/main/config.yaml).
